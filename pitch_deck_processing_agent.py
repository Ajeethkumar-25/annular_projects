        You are an expert venture capitalist who analyzes pitch decks for investments. I need you to extract specific information from the text of a pitch deck. The pitch deck may not explicitly label all fields, so use your expertise to identify and extract the information that best matches each category.

        INSTRUCTIONS:
        1. Analyze the text carefully to find the requested information.
        2. If the exact information is not labeled, look for related concepts and make reasonable inferences.
        3. If information for a field is truly not present, use "N/A".
        4. Return your answers ONLY as a JSON object with the exact field names provided.

        FIELDS TO EXTRACT:

        1. "Startup Name": The company name, typically on the first slide, in headers/footers, or after phrases like "introducing" or "about us".

        2. "Industry": The business sector or vertical (e.g., FinTech, Healthcare, SaaS, E-commerce). Look for explicit mentions or infer from the product/service description.

        3. "Startup Stage": Development phase (e.g., Pre-seed, Seed, Series A, Growth). May be mentioned in funding history or company timeline.

        4. "Funding Goal": The amount of money the startup is seeking to raise in this round. Look for phrases like "raising", "seeking", "investment opportunity" followed by dollar amounts.

        5. "Business Model": How the company generates value and operates (e.g., B2B, B2C, marketplace, subscription). Look for descriptions of how the business works.

        6. "Core Technology": The main technical innovation or platform the startup uses (e.g., AI, blockchain, proprietary algorithm). Look in sections about technology, product, or competitive advantage.

        7. "Revenue Model": How the company makes money (e.g., subscription, commission, freemium, pay-per-use). Look for mentions of pricing, revenue streams, or monetization.

        8. "Burn Rate": Monthly cash spend or rate at which company uses capital. Often in financial projections or funding slides.

        9. "Projected 12M Revenue": Expected revenue for the next 12 months. Look in financial projections, often labeled as "projected revenue" or shown in charts.

        10. "Customer Base": Description of current customers, either as specific numbers or general description. Look for "customers", "users", "clients", "partnerships".

        11. "Churn Rate": Customer attrition rate, often expressed as a percentage. May be in metrics, KPIs, or financial sections.

        12. "TAM" (Total Addressable Market): The total potential market size, usually the largest market figure mentioned, often in billions. Look for phrases like "total market size", "global opportunity".

        13. "SAM" (Serviceable Available Market): The portion of TAM the company can realistically target based on their business model and geography, typically smaller than TAM. Look for "target market" or "addressable market".

        14. "SOM" (Serviceable Obtainable Market): The realistic portion of SAM the company can capture in the near term (often 3-5 years). The smallest market figure, sometimes shown as percentage of SAM or in revenue projections.

        - Tech Stack Assessment: {tech_stack}
        - Product Readiness Evaluation: {product_readiness}

        Based on this information, provide three key investment assessment metrics:

        1. SIGNAL STRENGTH (Credibility Check): 
           Rate as "High", "Moderate", or "Low" - Assess the credibility of the startup's claims, consistency of information, and alignment with industry benchmarks.

        2. INNOVATION INDEX (Tech Maturity): 
           Rate as "High", "Moderate", or "Low" - Evaluate the technological differentiation, maturity of the solution, and alignment with industry technology trends.

        3. MARKET PULSE (Business Viability): 
           Rate as "High", "Moderate", or "Low" - Assess market opportunity, competitive positioning, and overall business model viability.

        For each metric, provide:
        - A clear rating (High/Moderate/Low)
        - A detailed 150-200 word assessment explaining the rating, citing specific factors from the analysis
